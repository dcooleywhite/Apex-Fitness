# Apex-Fitness

By: Donyea Cooley-White

APEX Fitness began as a CAPSTONE project at Metropolitan State University. Group members included Caleb Dilworth, Ser Xiong, Addisu Gebremedhin,
and myself. The project spanned a full semester and four iterations. The application itself is a 3-tiered web app desgined using the 
Eclipse IDE. The project officially ended on December 8th, 2016. Since then, I have been making personal updates and improvements.


# Application
The goal of our project was to create a fitness application targeted for users with minimal access to equipment. By submitting
basic information, your fitness goal, and any equipment available, the application will build a workout plan to suit your needs.

There are 5 basic functions to the application:
- Update Equipement
- Search Exercises
- Create Workout
- Complete Workout
- Redo Workout

# Software and Dependencies

The application itself was built using the Eclipse IDE.

The backend is supported by a MySQL Database implemented with MySQL Workbench. 

The application runs on a local Tomcat 8 server.

Passwords are hashed using the jBCrypt (http://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/)
